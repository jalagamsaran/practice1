   <br>
  <em> <h4 align="center" class="a">The northern lights are one of nature's most magical sights, but they're also one of the most unpredictable. Maximize your chance of seeing nature’s most spectacular light show with this complete guide before embarking on a northern lights tour or renting a car on Iceland's biggest travel marketplace.

    Iceland’s northern lights are one of its major attractions, but the aurora borealis are fickle. They’re only visible under certain conditions, at certain times of the year, and only with enough solar activity. Knowing when you can see the northern lights in Iceland is essential for ensuring you have the best chances of a once-in-a-lifetime viewing.</h4></em>

    <br>
    <em><h4 align="center">The best time to see aurora borealis in Iceland is between September and April. It’s when the nights are dark enough to see the aurora.

        Iceland only gets 4-5 hours of daylight in midwinter, providing endless opportunities to hunt for aurora borealis during that time.Northern lights tours run between September and April. While there’s no particularly optimum time between this range, the nights are the darkest from November to January. This means you can seek the aurora in Iceland from late
         afternoon until nearly noon the next day, which provides perfect conditions to photograph the northern lights.</h4></em>

    <br>
    <em><h4 align="center" class="b">
        The main marble caves are accessible from Puerto Tranquilo, a small town right on the Carretera Austral, making it an easy stop-off for those doing a self-drive adventure down the famous road. From Puerto Tranquilo, you can take a kayak or boat trip right into the maze of marble caves, spending around an hour exploring.
        This whole section of the General Carrera Lake shore is full of marble caves and islands, and if you want to get off-the-beaten-track and have a little time, you can visit different caves from nearby villages. These often require slightly longer boat trips and bumpy dirt roads, perfect for those seeking a little more adventure. Base yourself at Terra Luna for easy access to a boat trip.</h4></em>

        <br>
        <em><h4 align="center">
            With good weather, the Marble Caves are an unmissable feature of this part of the Carretera Austral. If you're in the area, it's certainly worth stopping off for a few hours to explore them, or even spending a day taking a boat out to the more hidden caves and islands. However it's worth mentioning that the whole Aysen region is packed full of sweeping valleys, crashing glaciers, verdant forests, turquoise lakes and river torrents. 
       There's so much to see here, we recommend fitting the Marble Caves into your itinerary, rather than building it around them.

    <br>
    <em><h4 align="center" class="c1">
    Located on the northern slopes of the magnificent Black Cuillin range, Skye’s famous Fairy Pools are beautiful crystal-clear blue pools on the Allt Coire a' Mhadaidh (Burn of the Dog),
     which can be seen snaking down the hillside of Coire na Creiche into Glen Brittle where it becomes the River Brittle.This walk is suitable in most normal weather conditions but, if it has b
     een raining hard, the water tends to rise fast and high in very wet weather. During the winter months, the Glenbrittle road may ice, so caution is advised to anyone visiting the pools between November and March.

    This first waterfall marks the start of the magical pools. Take some time to work your way up the river and explore all the pools. Some of the pools make great swimming, but rarely get warm (a wetsuit is a good option).
This first waterfall is the highest fall and deepest pool. For the brave only there are some great high jumps. On the other side of the river from the path it is possible to jump into deep blue pool (approximately 10 metres high).

Follow the main path up beside the river to find more pools.
The next pool is probably the most famous of them all: a beautiful clear blue pool which is ideal for swimming. It features a natural arch, offering an exhilarating underwater swim though it.
There many small pools as you work your way up the river.
